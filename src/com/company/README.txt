This is a simple text-based application that allows you to create numerous playlists of academic videos for student use.
For each video, you can create associated quiz questions and leave comments.

This is an explanation of each required field needed for successful playlist upload in this program. As an example,
each field of the included "input.txt" file is explained here so you know how to format your own files for upload.

Note: Any text preceded by "//" cannot be included in your upload files

3                           //Video count: Number of videos that will be uploaded in this file

59                          //Length of video in minutes

Any differences in formatting or discrepancies in data (such as having a different number of included videos from that indicated by the
"Video count" field) will result in errors when creating and subsequently using the playlist.
